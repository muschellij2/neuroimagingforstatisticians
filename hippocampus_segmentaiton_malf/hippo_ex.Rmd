## Introduction of Problem
Many analyses focus on a specific region or set of regions in the brain.  These analyses can focus on a wide variety of statistics about these regions, such as the peak activation in the region, amount of atropy, or the volume of the region/structure.

We will be focusing on the volume of the region.  In this example, we will show how to take a T1-weighted image and segment the hippocampus.  We will be using an approach generally described
